## ⚠️ WEEK 3 RISK FACTORS

**Things that could derail us:**

1. **No customer responses** (Intuit, Uber, State Farm all silent)
   - Mitigation: Expand to 20 companies contacted
   
2. **Lawyer too expensive** (>$1,000 for contract review)
   - Mitigation: Use contract templates, get review later

3. **Can't find developer** (no Zach referral, Upwork too expensive)
   - Mitigation: Night builds MVP API solo (slower but possible)

4. **Alexander doesn't respond** (partnership dead)
   - Mitigation: Proceed with bootstrap plan

5. **Unexpected expenses** (burn >$1,500)
   - Mitigation: Cut non-essentials, stay disciplined

**We're prepared for all scenarios** ✅

---

## 🎯 WEEK 3 PHILOSOPHY

**This is foundation week:**
- Not trying to close customers yet
- Not trying to build full product yet
- **Trying to:** Set up legal/business foundation, map processes, expand pipeline, make strategic decisions

**Quality over speed:**
- Take time to get contracts right (with lawyer)
- Take time to map processes thoroughly
- Take time to make good strategic decisions
- Don't rush into customer conversations unprepared

**Trust the process:**
- If Zach/Alexander come through, great
- If not, we bootstrap
- Either way, we're building solid foundation
- Week 4-6 is when we accelerate

---

## ✅ WEEK 3 READY

**Status:** Detailed plan complete  
**Hours Required:** ~60-80 hours (12-16 hours/day × 5 days)  
**Budget:** $640-1,250  
**Outcome:** Foundation ready for customer pilots

**This week sets up everything that follows.** 🎯
