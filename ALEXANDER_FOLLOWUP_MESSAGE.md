## 📧 FOLLOW-UP MESSAGE (Send Saturday or Sunday)

**To:** Alexander Liteplo (RentAHuman Founder)  
**Platform:** LinkedIn  
**Status:** Connection made Feb 12, awaiting response  
**Timeline:** Send follow-up Feb 14-15 if no response by then

### **VERSION 1: Direct & Honest (Recommended)**

```
Hi Alexander,

Following up on my message from earlier this week about HumanAIOS.

Quick context: We're building the enterprise AI → human task interface 
(think: TurboTax AI retrieving W-2s, Uber AI inspecting vehicles, 
insurance AI documenting accidents). We're pre-launch and seeking 
pilot partners.

I've researched RentAHuman - you've built exactly the worker pool and 
infrastructure we need. Rather than compete, I'd love to explore how 
we could work together:

- You have 70K workers and crypto payment infrastructure
- We're building enterprise B2B sales + fiat payment layer
- Together: Your workers + our enterprise customers = revenue for both

Would a 20-minute call next week make sense? I'm happy to share more 
details on the opportunity.

Best,
Night
HumanAIOS (Pre-launch)

### **VERSION 2: Shorter & More Casual**

```
Alexander,

Quick follow-up: I'm building the enterprise layer for AI → human tasks. 

You've already solved the hard problem (70K workers, payment infrastructure). 
I'm solving a different one (enterprise B2B sales, AI agent integration).

Feels like a natural partnership - your workers, our enterprise customers.

20-min call next week to explore?

Best,
Night

## 📋 IF HE RESPONDS - NEXT STEPS

### **Response Type 1: "Tell me more"**

**Our reply:**
```
Great! Here's the quick version:

PROBLEM: AI agents can think but can't act in physical world. TurboTax AI 
can't retrieve W-2s. Uber AI can't inspect vehicles. State Farm AI can't 
document accidents.

SOLUTION: We connect AI agents with verified human workers to execute 
physical tasks. Enterprise B2B focus (Fortune 500 customers).

YOUR ROLE: Worker pool + infrastructure (you've already built this)
OUR ROLE: Enterprise sales, AI agent integration, fiat payments

OPPORTUNITY: 
- We've identified $6-9B annual market across 25 companies
- Already contacted Intuit, Uber, State Farm this week
- Pre-launch, seeking 2-3 pilot partners for Q1

PARTNERSHIP MODEL: 
- Your workers execute tasks we sell to enterprises
- Revenue share on tasks (TBD - open to discussion)
- We handle enterprise sales/contracts, you handle worker ops

Available for call Monday-Friday next week. What works for you?
```

---

### **Response Type 2: "What's the business model?"**

**Our reply:**
```
Three-way value creation:

1. ENTERPRISES pay for tasks ($25-100/task depending on complexity)
2. WORKERS get paid for execution (70-80% of task value)
3. PLATFORM takes fee (20-30% - split between us if partnership)

Example: Intuit pays $25 for W-2 retrieval
- Worker gets $20
- Platform fee: $5
- If we partner: $2.50 to you (worker ops), $2.50 to us (enterprise sales)

Volume potential:
- Intuit alone: 125K tasks/month during tax season = $625K monthly revenue
- 25 target companies = $500K-750K monthly potential Year 1

We're pre-revenue, seeking pilots. But the market is there NOW 
(tax season, OpenAI Frontier partners launching).

Call to discuss details?
```

### **Response Type 3: "Not interested" or No Response**

**If he says no:**
```
Totally understand. Thanks for considering it, and best of luck with 
RentAHuman - you've built something impressive.

If anything changes or you know someone who might be interested in 
this space, I'd appreciate the intro.

Best,
Night
```

**Move on gracefully, no hard feelings**

**If no response after follow-up (by Feb 21):**
- Don't follow up again
- Focus on other paths (bootstrap, customers, other partners)
- Door stays open, but we don't chase
