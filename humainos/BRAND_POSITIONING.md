# HumanAIOS - Brand & Positioning

## Product Name: **HumanAIOS**

**Domain**: humainos.ai
**Tagline**: "The Operating System for Human-AI Workflows"

**Elevator Pitch** (30 seconds):
"HumanAIOS is the only platform that orchestrates BOTH AI agents AND human workers. While others just monitor what your AI does, we help when your AI can't do it alone. Monitor every agent action, track costs in real-time, and automatically delegate physical-world tasks to humans - all in one system."

**Key Differentiator** (vs Competitors):
"Braintrust, Arize, and Maxim monitor AI agents. RentAHuman connects you to humans. We're the ONLY platform that integrates both - giving you complete orchestration of hybrid AI-human workflows."

**Problem Statement**:
"Companies are deploying AI agents but have no visibility into what they're doing, how much they're costing, or how to handle the tasks AI can't complete. When agents need someone to verify a location, pick up a package, or attend a meeting, there's no system to manage these handoffs."

**Solution**:
"HumanAIOS gives you complete visibility and control over human-AI workflows. Monitor every agent action, track costs per task, automatically detect when human help is needed, and orchestrate the handoff - all with enterprise-grade security and compliance."

**We're the ONLY player in the top-right quadrant!**

### Competitive Threats Assessment

**Short-term (0-6 months): LOW**
- No one building human orchestration yet
- Focus on shipping MVP and getting customers

**Medium-term (6-12 months): MODERATE**
- AgentOps or Langfuse could add human tasks (fast-moving startups)
- RentAHuman could add AI monitoring (but harder)
- Mitigation: Network effects, first-mover advantage, integration partnerships

**Long-term (12+ months): HIGHER**
- OpenAI Frontier could add human delegation
- Microsoft/Google could bundle it
- Mitigation: Customer lock-in, deep integrations, marketplace liquidity

## Design Partner Outreach Template

**Subject**: "Early access: AI agent monitoring + human task orchestration"

**Body**:
Hey [Name],

I noticed you're working with [MCP/AI agents/specific tech] at [Company]. We're building something you might find useful.

**The problem**: Companies running AI agents have no visibility into what they're doing, costs are unpredictable, and when agents need human help for physical tasks, it's all manual spreadsheets.

**What we're building**: HybridOS - a dashboard that monitors all your AI agents AND orchestrates human tasks they can't handle. Think Datadog meets RentAHuman.

**Where we're at**: Working MVP, launching beta next week. Looking for 5 design partners to shape the product.

**What you get**: Free access, direct influence on product direction, first-mover advantage when we launch.

**The ask**: 30-minute call to show you what we've built and get your feedback?

[Calendar link]

Thanks,
[Your name]

P.S. Here's a 2-minute demo: [link]
