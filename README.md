## 🎯 Mission

Technology serving AI-human cooperation. Every dollar of profit funds recovery services for marginalized communities.

**Not AI replacing humans. AI cooperating WITH humans.**

## 🎯 For Enterprise AI Agent Teams

If you're deploying **OpenAI Frontier** or **Anthropic Cowork** at enterprise scale, you've discovered AI agents can't execute physical-world tasks:

❌ Property inspections  
❌ Document pickups  
❌ Equipment verifications  
❌ In-person meetings  

**HumanAIOS provides the enterprise-grade physical execution layer:**

✅ 374K verified workers (via RentAHuman partnership)  
✅ Fiat payment infrastructure (unlock 87% crypto-blocked workers)  
✅ Quality SLA (photo/GPS/rating verification)  
✅ MCP integration (seamless Frontier/Cowork connectivity)  

**Early customers include Fortune 500 companies in:**
- Insurance (claims inspections)
- Technology (product testing)  
- Healthcare (lab sample logistics)
- Finance (document verification)

## 🚀 What We're Building

When AI agents (OpenAI Frontier, Anthropic Claude) need physical-world execution:
- On-site inspections
- Package retrieval
- Document handling
- Local verification
- In-person meetings

HumanAIOS automatically routes these tasks to qualified human workers via established marketplaces (TaskRabbit, RentAHuman).

**Result:** AI agents get seamless access to the physical world. Humans get dignified income.

## 💰 Financial Covenant

We're committed to transparent allocation of all profits:

| Revenue Tier | Family/Operations | Recovery Services | Reinvestment |
|--------------|-------------------|-------------------|--------------|
| $0-10K MRR | 100% | 0% | 0% |
| $10K-50K MRR | 60% | 30% | 10% |
| $50K+ MRR | 40% | 50% | 10% |

**Full transparency:** We publish all numbers quarterly.

**Why?** Technology should fund recovery, not just extraction.
