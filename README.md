# HumanAIOS

**The Physical Execution Layer for Enterprise AI Agents**

HumanAIOS connects enterprise AI agents (OpenAI Frontier, Anthropic Cowork) with verified human workers for physical task execution. We enable AI-human cooperation at scale while funding recovery programs with 100% of profits.

## 🤝 Building in Public

We're building HumanAIOS completely transparently:

**What's Public:**
- All strategic documentation (this repository)
- Mission and financial commitments
- Process frameworks (freely copyable)
- 12 Traditions governance
- Timeline and progress

**What's Private:**
- Customer contact details
- Partnership negotiations
- Personal financial information beyond public covenant
- Competitive intelligence

**Why Build in Public:**
- Accountability (public Financial Covenant enforces commitment)
- Replicability (pattern is free for others to copy)
- Movement building (cooperative tech infrastructure)
- Transparency (demonstrates principles in action)

## 💡 Key Innovations

### 1. AI Performance Improvement (AIPI) Framework
Adapted Human Performance Technology (Gilbert's BEM) to AI systems. Six-box model optimizes AI-human collaboration through systematic analysis of context quality, tools, feedback, knowledge, capacity, and alignment.

[Full AIPI Framework →](docs/process/AI_PERFORMANCE_IMPROVEMENT_MODEL.md)

### 2. Harmonized Workflows
Parallel execution model where human and AI work simultaneously on complementary tasks. Achieves 40-60% time savings while maintaining quality.

[Workflow Documentation →](docs/process/HARMONIZED_WORKFLOWS.md)

### 3. 12 Traditions Governance
Recovery program principles (Alcoholics Anonymous) applied to business decisions. Ensures mission integrity, self-supporting model, and principles-before-personalities approach.

## 🎯 How It Works

**For Enterprise AI Agents:**
1. AI agent (Frontier, Cowork) needs physical task
2. Routes request through HumanAIOS API
3. Task assigned to verified human worker
4. Quality verification (GPS, photos, ratings)
5. Results returned to AI agent
6. Payment processing automated

**For Human Workers:**
- Fiat payment (unlocks 87% more workers than crypto-only)
- Flexible work (choose tasks, set availability)
- Quality ratings (build reputation)
- Enterprise volume (consistent work opportunities)

**For Recovery Programs:**
- 30-50% of profits directly funded
- Sustainable model (not dependent on grants)
- Scalable impact (more customers = more recovery funding)
- Transparent tracking (public financial reporting)

---

## 🏗️ Technology Stack

**Integration:**
- MCP (Model Context Protocol) for AI agent connection
- RentAHuman API for worker marketplace
- Stripe for payment processing

**Quality Verification:**
- GPS location verification
- Photo documentation
- Rating system (1-5 stars + text reviews)
- Time tracking

**Infrastructure:**
- Node.js backend
- Authentication system
- RESTful API
- Cloud hosting (deployment pending)
