# Social Media Updates - Day 4

## LinkedIn Post

I'm building in public: Day 4 of the 30-day sprint to launch HumanAIOS.

Today's milestone: Our MCP SDK is working end-to-end. 🎉

What is HumanAIOS?
→ We bridge AI agents and human workers
→ Enterprises monitor their AI deployments  
→ When AI needs help, tasks route to humans
→ Workers earn dignified income ($50-175/hr)

Why this matters:
TechCrunch just declared "2026: Year of the Humans." The industry is realizing AI augments humans, not replaces them. We're building the infrastructure to make that real.

What we shipped today:
✅ @humanaios/mcp-sdk - TypeScript client library
✅ Full API integration tested
✅ Agent management + activity logging
✅ Ready for RentAHuman partnership (70K+ workers)

Building something that matters. 30 days to prove it's possible.

Our MCP SDK just passed end-to-end testing. AI agents can now programmatically create tasks and (soon) hire human workers.

The future of human-AI cooperation is taking shape. 🧵

2/ What we shipped:
✅ TypeScript SDK

3/ TechCrunch: "2026 will be the year of the humans"

The narrative is shifting: AI replacing humans → AI augmenting humans.

We're building the infrastructure that makes cooperation WORK.
