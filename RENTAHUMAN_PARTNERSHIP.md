# RentAHuman.ai Partnership Outreach

## Email Draft 1: Partnership Introduction

**Subject:** Partnership Opportunity: Integrate RentAHuman with AI Agent Orchestration Platform

**To:** team@rentahuman.ai (or found contact)

**Body:**

Hi RentAHuman Team,

I'm reaching out from HumanAIOS - we're building the orchestration layer for AI-human workflows, and I think there's a compelling partnership opportunity.

**What We're Building:**
HumanAIOS is a platform that helps companies monitor their AI agents AND orchestrate the human tasks those agents can't complete. Think of us as the "operating system" that sits between AI agent platforms (like CrewAI, LangChain) and human task marketplaces (like RentAHuman).

**The Partnership Idea:**
We'd love to integrate RentAHuman as a primary human worker marketplace within HumanAIOS. Here's how it would work:

1. Companies use HumanAIOS to monitor their AI agents
2. When an agent detects it needs human help (delivery verification, physical pickup, location check, etc.)
3. HumanAIOS automatically routes the task to RentAHuman's marketplace
4. Task gets completed, tracked, and logged - all in one system

**Value for RentAHuman:**
- New distribution channel (B2B SaaS companies building AI agents)
- Higher volume of tasks from automated routing
- Integration with existing AI workflows (not just one-off tasks)
- Position as the enterprise-grade human marketplace for AI agents

**Value for HumanAIOS:**
- Immediate access to worker supply (don't need to bootstrap our own marketplace initially)
- Proven task completion infrastructure
- Focus on our core competency (AI-human orchestration)

**Next Steps:**
Would you be open to a 30-minute call to discuss? I'd love to learn more about your API capabilities and explore how we could work together.

Our launch timeline: MVP in 4 weeks, looking for integration partners now.

Best regards,
[Your Name]
Founder, HumanAIOS

P.S. - We've already built the agent monitoring infrastructure and have interest from several AI companies. A RentAHuman integration would be a perfect complement.

## Email Draft 2: Technical Partnership (If they respond)

**Subject:** Re: Partnership Opportunity - Technical Details

Hi [Name],

Thanks for your interest! Here are more technical details on the integration:

**Integration Architecture:**

From HumanAIOS:
- We detect when an AI agent needs human assistance
- We classify the task type (pickup, delivery, verification, inspection, etc.)
- We send task details via API to RentAHuman

To RentAHuman API:
- POST /api/tasks - Create new task
- GET /api/tasks/:id - Check task status
- Webhook for completion notifications

From RentAHuman back:
- Task accepted/in-progress/completed status
- Worker assignment details
- Completion verification (photos, signatures, etc.)
- Invoicing/payment details

**What We Need from You:**
1. API documentation (if public) or access for integration
2. Sandbox/test environment
3. Pricing structure for B2B volume discounts (if applicable)
4. Typical task completion times by category
5. Geographic coverage details

**What We Can Provide:**
1. Steady flow of tasks from AI agent customers
2. Detailed task context and requirements (structured data)
3. Enterprise customer relationships
4. Co-marketing opportunities
5. Product feedback loop

**Timeline:**
- Week 2: API integration development
- Week 3: Testing and QA
- Week 4: Beta launch with 5 design partners
- Month 2: Scale to 25+ customers

Interested in discussing further?

Best,
[Your Name]

## Email Draft 3: Value Proposition (Alternative opener)

**Subject:** New Distribution Channel for RentAHuman - AI Agent Market

Hi team,

Quick question: Has RentAHuman considered how to reach the thousands of companies now building AI agents who need human task execution?

We're building HumanAIOS - an orchestration platform for AI-human workflows - and we see a major opportunity to connect your marketplace to this emerging market.

**The Opportunity:**
- 1000s of companies building AI agents (CrewAI, LangChain, custom)
- Every agent eventually needs human help for physical-world tasks
- Currently no good way to bridge AI systems → human workers
- RentAHuman already has the infrastructure

**The Integration:**
We route tasks from AI agents → RentAHuman's marketplace automatically. Your workers get more consistent volume, we get proven execution infrastructure.

**One Question:**
Do you have an API for programmatic task creation, or are you open to building one for enterprise partners?

Let me know if you'd like to explore this!
