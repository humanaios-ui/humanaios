## 💡 OUTREACH STRATEGY

**When to contact:**
- **Option A - Early:** Reach out now for partnership/collaboration discussion
- **Option B - After validation:** Contact after we have 2-3 enterprise customers (proof)
- **Option C - Competitive:** Don't contact, use as competitive intelligence only

**Recommended approach:** Option B (contact after validation)

**Why wait:**
- We need proof our model works before partnership discussion
- Approaching with customers = stronger negotiating position
- RentAHuman partnership could accelerate distribution significantly

**Potential partnership models:**
1. **Payment processing:** We handle fiat payments for their workers
2. **Enterprise integration:** We provide enterprise verification layer for their platform
3. **White-label:** They use our infrastructure for enterprise clients
4. **Referral:** We send overflow work to their platform, vice versa

## 📧 DRAFT OUTREACH (For Future Use)

**Subject:** Solving the fiat payment gap for RentAHuman workers

Hi Patricia,

I'm Night, building HumanAIOS - a physical execution layer for enterprise AI agents. I've been following RentAHuman and noticed the crypto-only payment limitation affects 87% of potential workers.

We've built a fiat payment infrastructure that might solve this for your platform. Our early enterprise customers (State Farm, Intuit, HP) need verified workers but require standard invoicing - something crypto makes difficult.

Would you be open to a 20-minute exploratory conversation about potential collaboration? We're not competitors - we're focused on enterprise AI integration, not consumer marketplace.

Best,  
Night Anderson  
Founder, HumanAIOS
