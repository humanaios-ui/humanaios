2. Go through each tradition below
3. Answer honestly: Does this decision honor or violate?

## THE 12 TRADITIONS FILTER

### ✅ TRADITION 1: Common Welfare First

**The Tradition:**
"Our common welfare should come first; personal recovery depends upon AA unity."

**Translation for HumanAIOS:**
Mission and community welfare come before individual gain, ego, or convenience.

**Questions to Ask:**
- Does this serve the mission (AI-human cooperation, recovery funding) or my ego?
- Does this strengthen the community or fragment it?
- Does this prioritize long-term sustainability over short-term personal gain?
- Would this decision hurt the common welfare for individual benefit?

**Examples:**

✅ **HONORS Tradition 1:**

**The Tradition:**
"For our group purpose there is but one ultimate authority—a loving God as He may express Himself in our group conscience. Our leaders are but trusted servants; they do not govern."

**Translation for HumanAIOS:**
Ultimate authority is Universal Power (God/Higher Consciousness), not founder ego, not market pressure, not investor demands. Decisions made through prayer/meditation and group conscience.
