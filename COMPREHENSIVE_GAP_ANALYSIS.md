## 💰 FUNDING STRATEGY

### **Option A: Bootstrap (Recommended)**
- Address only 11 critical gaps: $7K-13K
- Use TaskRabbit for workers (delays app need)
- Close first customer to fund remaining gaps
- **Pros:** No dilution, validates market first
- **Cons:** Slower, higher risk

### **Option B: Partnership Path (Best Case)**
- Alexander partnership eliminates worker gaps
- Reduces cost to $5K-8K
- Focus on API/contracts only
- **Pros:** Fastest path, lowest cost
- **Cons:** Dependent on partnership closing

### **Option C: Raise Capital**
- Raise $25K-50K angel round
- Address all critical + high priority
- Build proper foundation
- **Pros:** Proper capitalization
- **Cons:** Dilution, time to raise

**Recommended:** Try B → If fails, do A → Raise C only if necessary
