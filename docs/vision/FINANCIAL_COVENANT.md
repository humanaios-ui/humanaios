# Financial Covenant: Sacred Commitments

**Created:** February 8, 2026  
**Purpose:** Define non-negotiable financial principles and revenue allocation

## 🛡️ SACRED COMMITMENTS

### Foundation Principle

**Family stability is the bedrock of all mission work.**

Without this foundation, nothing else is sustainable. Therefore:

**We covenant to NEVER:**
- Launch Lasting Light operations without 6-month family runway
- Scale faster than revenue supports
- Accept funding that compromises family security
- Sacrifice household needs for mission expansion
- Operate from scarcity or panic

**We covenant to ALWAYS:**
- Prioritize family financial health
- Maintain transparent accounting
- Review allocation quarterly
- Adjust only with full alignment
- Build surplus before expansion

### Quarterly Review (Sacred Ritual)

2. **Assess Health** - Each system (family, business, mission)
3. **Check Alignment** - Does this still serve the vision?
4. **Adjust if Needed** - Only with full consent and discernment
5. **Recommit** - Renew covenant or revise thoughtfully

**Participants:**
- Founder (you)
- Spouse/family (if applicable)
- Advisory council (when formed)
- Meditation/prayer discernment

**Questions to Answer:**
- Is family stable and thriving?
- Is HumanAIOS sustainable and growing?
- Is Lasting Light launching appropriately?
- Are we staying true to vision?
- What needs to change?

## 🚨 EMERGENCY PROTOCOLS

### Scenario 1: Revenue Drop (>30% decline for 2 months)

**Immediate Actions:**
1. Pause all Lasting Light expansion
2. Reduce HumanAIOS burn to essentials
3. Prioritize family runway extension
4. Analyze cause (market, product, execution?)
5. Develop recovery plan before resuming mission spending

**Decision Rule:** Family comes first. Always.

---

### Scenario 2: Unexpected Expense (>$10K urgent need)

**Response:**
1. Assess source (family, business, mission?)
2. Draw from appropriate reserves first
3. Pause expansion in affected area
4. Rebuild reserves before continuing
5. Review to prevent recurrence

**Decision Rule:** Emergency fund exists for emergencies. Use it, then rebuild.

---

### Scenario 3: Major Opportunity (partnership, grant, investment)

**Evaluation:**
1. Does it align with vision?
2. Does it compromise family security?
3. Does it create unsustainable obligations?
4. Does it serve both revenue AND mission?
5. Does discernment feel clear?

**Decision Rule:** If any answer is concerning, decline or delay until clarity emerges.
