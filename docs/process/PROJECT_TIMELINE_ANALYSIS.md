## 🔄 CONTINGENCY PLANS

### **If Partnership Delays (After Feb 14):**

**Plan B: Direct Worker Recruitment**
- LinkedIn: Post for workers (100+ connections)
- Twitter: Worker recruitment tweet
- Personal network: Friends in recovery community
- Target: 10 workers by Feb 20

**Impact:** Smaller pool but still viable for pilot

---

### **If No Customer Commit by Feb 24:**

**Plan B: Delay Launch to Mar 15**
- Use extra 2 weeks for more outreach
- Polish platform further
- Build demo/marketing materials
- Lower pilot pricing (first month free)

**Impact:** 2-week delay, still Q1

---

### **If Technical Integration Fails:**

**Plan B: Manual Coordination Layer**
- Human task routing (manual matching)
- Email-based worker coordination
- Stripe for payments (not crypto)
- Prove model, then automate

**Impact:** Slower but proves concept
