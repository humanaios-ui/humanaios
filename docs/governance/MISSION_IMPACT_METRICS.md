# MISSION IMPACT METRICS
## Measuring What Actually Matters

**Created:** February 10, 2026  
**Purpose:** Track mission impact, not just revenue  
**Review:** Weekly tracking, monthly analysis, quarterly public sharing

---

## WHY THIS MATTERS

**Most startups track:** Revenue, growth, users, engagement  
**We also track:** Lives changed, dignity restored, recovery funded, cooperation demonstrated

**Revenue is a MEANS, not the END.**

The end: AI-human cooperation that funds recovery and restores dignity.

**If we're profitable but not serving the mission, we've failed.**

## THE CORE METRICS

### 📊 CATEGORY 1: DIRECT IMPACT (Recovery & Dignity)

**Metric 1.1: Recovery Services Funded**

**What we measure:**
- Total dollars allocated to recovery services (per Financial Covenant)
- Number of recovery programs/organizations funded
- Number of individuals served through recovery funding
- Types of services funded (housing, treatment, support groups, etc.)

**Target Allocation (from Financial Covenant):**
- Phase 1 ($0-10K MRR): $0 (building sustainability first)
- Phase 2 ($10K-50K MRR): 30% of revenue
- Phase 3 ($50K+ MRR): 50% of revenue

**How we track:**
- Monthly: Calculate allocation per covenant
- Quarterly: Distribute to recovery organizations
- Annually: Impact report on lives touched

**Success looks like:**
- By Dec 2026: $50K+ allocated to recovery services
- By Dec 2027: $500K+ allocated
- By 2028: $2M+ allocated (if we hit $400K MRR)

---

**Metric 1.2: Workers Earning Dignified Income**

**What we measure:**
- Number of unique human workers who received tasks through HumanAIOS
- Average earnings per worker per month
- Number of workers earning >$500/month (meaningful supplemental income)
- Number of workers earning >$2000/month (living wage potential)

**Target:**
- By Mar 2026: 10+ workers earned income
- By Jun 2026: 50+ workers earned income
- By Dec 2026: 200+ workers earned income
- By Dec 2027: 1000+ workers earned income

**Quality over quantity:**
- Better: 50 workers earning $1000/month ($50K total)
- Than: 500 workers earning $100/month ($50K total)
- Focus on MEANINGFUL income, not just "gig work"

**How we track:**
- Weekly: Track unique workers receiving tasks
- Monthly: Calculate average earnings, distribution
- Quarterly: Survey workers on impact of income

---

**Metric 1.3: Workers from Recovery Community**

**What we measure:**
- Number of workers who identify as being in recovery (voluntary disclosure)
- Percentage of total worker pool from recovery community
- Employment longevity for recovery workers vs others
- Recovery worker satisfaction scores

**Why this matters:**
Our mission explicitly serves marginalized/displaced people. Recovery community is core to this.

**Target:**
- By Dec 2026: 20%+ of workers from recovery community
- By Dec 2027: 30%+ of workers from recovery community
- Ongoing: Higher satisfaction and retention for recovery workers

**How we track:**
- Optional self-disclosure at worker signup
- Anonymous surveys quarterly
- Respect anonymity (aggregated data only)

- Worker satisfaction with task clarity

**Target:**
- Task completion rate: >95%
- Average completion time: <24 hours
- Customer satisfaction: >4/5 stars
- Worker satisfaction: >4/5 stars

**What this tells us:**
High success rate = cooperation is WORKING. AI agents can effectively work with humans.

**How we track:**
- Real-time: Platform dashboard

- Quarterly: Deep dive on why customers/workers stay or leave

---

**Metric 2.3: Complexity of Tasks (Evolution)**

**What we measure:**
- Types of tasks being routed (simple → complex over time)

- Number of times we had to reverse decision due to violation
- Community feedback on whether we're honoring Traditions

**Target:**
- 100% of major decisions filtered through Traditions
- Catch violations BEFORE executing (not after)
- Public accountability (share when we get it wrong)

**How we track:**
- Weekly: Review decisions against 12 Traditions checklist
- Monthly: Group conscience review (founder + wife + sponsor)
- Quarterly: Public sharing of how we're honoring Traditions

---

**Metric 3.3: Building in Public Authenticity**

**What we measure:**
- Frequency of public updates (transparency)
- Honesty about failures (not just successes)
- Community engagement and feedback
- Ratio of "wins shared" to "failures shared" (should be balanced)

**Target:**
- Weekly public updates (at minimum)
- Share failures as openly as successes
- Respond to community feedback genuinely
- Balance = ~50% wins, ~50% challenges/learnings

**What this tells us:**
Authentic public building = accountability. Can't hide failures. Can't fake mission alignment.

**How we track:**
- Count: Posts per week
- Categorize: Wins vs challenges vs learnings
- Analyze: Community feedback sentiment
- Adjust: Based on what community needs to see

**Why this matters:**
If we shift narrative from "AI replacing humans" to "AI cooperating with humans," we've won.

**Target:**
- By 2027: Recognized as cooperation infrastructure thought leaders
- Media: Shift from fear-focused to cooperation-focused coverage
- Industry: "Human-in-the-loop" becomes standard (not exception)

**How we track:**

## 🙏 CLOSING PRINCIPLE

**Revenue is a MEANS.**  
**Impact is the MEASURE.**  
**Mission is the MASTER.**

If we're profitable but not serving recovery → WE FAILED.  
If we're growing but not funding dignity → WE FAILED.  
If we're successful but compromised Traditions → WE FAILED.

**Success = Mission impact at scale, sustained by revenue, filtered through Traditions.**

**These metrics keep us honest.**
