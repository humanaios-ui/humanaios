## 🙏 CLOSING STATEMENT

**To the Cherokee Nation Commerce Services team:**

Wado (thank you) for taking the time to review this proposal.

I am Night Anderson, a Cherokee Nation citizen in recovery, and I am asking for your partnership to build something that serves our people.

Just as Cherokee Nation invests $49.7 million in physical community buildings to sustain our culture, heritage, and traditions, I'm asking Cherokee Nation to invest in economic community infrastructure through HumanAIOS.

Your SSBCI program exists to fund exactly this: Cherokee entrepreneurs who want to show their families a new way to live and break generational trauma through business.

That's me. That's this business.

I'm not asking for charity. I'm asking to be part of Cherokee Nation's economic sovereignty story. I'm asking to help carry forward what our ancestors fought to preserve. I'm asking to build something that makes our community proud.

The timing is perfect:
- Your $86.9M SSBCI program just launched
- Your Recovery Employment Program needs employment partners
- Your Innovation Hub needs success stories
- The AI economy is emerging NOW
- Native founders receive only 0.02% of startup funding - we can change that

I am ready to work. I am ready to serve. I am ready to make Cherokee Nation proud.

**Gadugi - working together for the common good.**

Will you partner with me?
