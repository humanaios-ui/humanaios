# HumanAIOS - Brand & Positioning

## Product Name: **HumanAIOS**

**Domain**: humainos.ai
**Tagline**: "The Operating System for Human-AI Workflows"

**Elevator Pitch** (30 seconds):
"HumanAIOS is the mission control for companies running AI agents. We're the only platform that monitors your AI agents AND orchestrates the human tasks they can't do themselves. See everything your agents are doing, track costs in real-time, and seamlessly hand off physical-world tasks to humans - all in one dashboard."

**Problem Statement**:
"Companies are deploying AI agents but have no visibility into what they're doing, how much they're costing, or how to handle the tasks AI can't complete. When agents need someone to verify a location, pick up a package, or attend a meeting, there's no system to manage these handoffs."

**Solution**:
"HumanAIOS gives you complete visibility and control over human-AI workflows. Monitor every agent action, track costs per task, automatically detect when human help is needed, and orchestrate the handoff - all with enterprise-grade security and compliance."

## Competitive Differentiation

### vs. Traditional Agent Monitoring (LangSmith, Arize, etc.)
**Them**: "Monitor your AI agents"
**Us**: "Monitor AND orchestrate AI + humans"

**Key Difference**: We handle the full workflow including human tasks, not just AI activities.

### vs. RentAHuman.ai
**Them**: "Marketplace for AI agents to hire humans"
**Us**: "Complete AI-human orchestration platform with built-in marketplace"

**Key Difference**: We're the orchestration layer, they're just the marketplace. We'll integrate them AND build our own.

### vs. Traditional Workflow Tools (Zapier, n8n)
**Them**: "Automate workflows"
**Us**: "Orchestrate AI-human hybrid workflows"

**Key Difference**: Purpose-built for AI agents, not generic automation.

## Design Partner Outreach Template

**Subject**: "Early access: AI agent monitoring + human task orchestration"

**Body**:
Hey [Name],

I noticed you're working with [MCP/AI agents/specific tech] at [Company]. We're building something you might find useful.

**The problem**: Companies running AI agents have no visibility into what they're doing, costs are unpredictable, and when agents need human help for physical tasks, it's all manual spreadsheets.

**What we're building**: HybridOS - a dashboard that monitors all your AI agents AND orchestrates human tasks they can't handle. Think Datadog meets RentAHuman.

**Where we're at**: Working MVP, launching beta next week. Looking for 5 design partners to shape the product.

**What you get**: Free access, direct influence on product direction, first-mover advantage when we launch.

**The ask**: 30-minute call to show you what we've built and get your feedback?

[Calendar link]

Thanks,
[Your name]

P.S. Here's a 2-minute demo: [link]
