## 📧 MESSAGE 1: STATE FARM (Joe Park)

**To:** Joe Park - SVP Innovation at State Farm  
**Subject Line:** N/A (LinkedIn message)  
**Length:** 300 characters max (LinkedIn limit for non-connections)

### **Version A: Short & Direct**

```
Hi Joe,

I'm building the AI → physical world interface for enterprise agents. State Farm's claims AI could dispatch verified accident scene documentation within 2 hours vs days.

Interested in a 15-min conversation about how this accelerates claims processing?

Best,
Night
```

**Character count:** 287 ✅

---

### **Version B: Problem-First**

```
Hi Joe,

Most claims delays happen waiting for documentation. What if State Farm's AI could dispatch verified accident scene documentation in 2 hours instead of 2 days?

I'm building this for enterprise AI agents. 15-min call to explore?

Best,
Night
```

**Character count:** 265 ✅

---

### **Recommended:** Version B (problem-first resonates with innovation leaders)

**When to send:** Today (Friday afternoon) or Monday morning  
**Follow-up:** If no response in 1 week, send connection request with note

---

## 📧 MESSAGE 2: COINBASE (Compliance Team)

**Research needed first:**
- Find specific compliance decision maker on LinkedIn
- Likely titles: "Head of Compliance", "VP Compliance", "Chief Compliance Officer"
- Filter Coinbase employees by "Compliance" keyword

### **Once Contact Identified - Use This Template:**

**Version A: Regulatory Focus**

```
Hi [Name],

Regulatory requirements for enhanced KYC on high-value accounts are tightening. What if Coinbase could dispatch in-person ID verification within 24 hours for institutional accounts?

I'm building this for crypto platforms. 15-min call?

Best,
Night
```

**Character count:** 281 ✅

---

**Version B: Fraud Prevention Focus**

```
Hi [Name],

Identity fraud costs crypto platforms millions. Coinbase could verify high-value accounts with in-person ID checks, not just digital scans.

Building this for fintech compliance teams. Quick call to discuss?

Best,
Night
```

**Character count:** 249 ✅

---

**Recommended:** Version A (compliance leaders care more about regulatory risk than fraud cost)

**When to send:** After identifying specific decision maker  
**Research time needed:** 15-20 minutes to find right person

### **Intuit (Alex Balazs) Follow-Up:**

```
Alex,

Following up on my message about enabling TurboTax AI to retrieve W-2s for users.

Tax season is in full swing. Would a quick proof-of-concept demo be helpful?

Best,

```

---

### **Uber (Andrew MacDonald) Follow-Up:**

## 💡 MESSAGE OPTIMIZATION TIPS

### **What Works on LinkedIn:**

✅ **Short** (under 300 characters for non-connections)  
✅ **Problem-first** (their pain, not our solution)  
✅ **Specific** (accident documentation, not "tasks")  
✅ **Low-commitment ask** (15-min call, not "demo" or "sales call")  
✅ **Professional but human** (not corporate-speak)

### **What Doesn't Work:**

❌ **Long** (over 500 characters - gets ignored)  
❌ **Feature-dump** ("We do X, Y, Z...")  
❌ **Vague** ("innovative solution for your needs")  
❌ **High-pressure** ("Can we schedule a call this week?")  
❌ **Salesy** ("I'd love to show you our product")
